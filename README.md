The Following are the key problem statements:

1.Calculate average median income of the data and visualize distribution using plots like histograms. Explain properties of distribution.

2.Generate plot for housing_median_age distribution. Examine and explain observations on distribution.

3.Visualize relationship between median_income and median_house_values using appropriate plots. Explain observations.

4.Create dataset removing examples where total_bedrooms data is missing.

5.Create dataset filling missing total_bedrooms data with mean value.

6.Write a function to calculate median value of dataset when required.

7.Plot latitude vs longitude. Examine and explain relationship observed.

8.Create dataset containing only examples where ocean_proximity is 'Near ocean'.

The Following are the conclutions

1.Calculated average median income using mean() and visualized distribution with histogram plot.

2.Generated histogram for housing_median_age distribution. Analyzed shape and peaks.

3.Created scatter plot between median_income and median_house_value. Calculated correlation coefficient.

4.Removed rows with missing total_bedrooms values using dropna().

5.Filled missing total_bedrooms by calculating mean and using fillna().

6.Defined function to calculate median values of selected columns.

7.Created scatter plot for latitude vs longitude.

8.Filtered data where ocean_proximity == 'Near ocean'.
